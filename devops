1. Draw an extensive CI pipeline for your application. 
   Provide CI pipeline with as many jobs needed to make sure your application is ready for production. 
   Just provide the job name (with 1 sentence description of the job) and link to the job that it triggers. 
   Pay attention that your application is written in Python, placed in github and is delivered as Docker image.

   Solution:
    * Git pull master branch from github.com (assuming that dev already merged to master the last version code)
    * Run Docker build to build a image contains the fresh code been pulled from github.com
    * Run Tests inside the Docker images (Running code tests on the build images to assure images been build as required).
    * Publish the new build image to docker registery, tag the image both with the current version tag and latest.
    * Connect to each Server in production, and pull the new image from docker registery
    * Start the new image, and stop the old one
    * Make a healthcheck to the instance and return it to production server pool.

2. What problems Agile tries to solve? (short sentence)
    * Inflexablity of developing process.
    * Long developing cycles.
    * Too much planing.
    * Customer can't make improvement during the development.

3. What problems DevOps tries to solve? (short sentence)
    * Better Build, and pipeline process.
    * Developers not focus only on developing.
    * IT enginers, have a lack of knowladge in development and applications.
